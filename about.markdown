## Welcome!

Hello and welcome to my blog! My name is Corentin, and I am a Datamancer (half data scientist, half software engineer) with over a decade of experience (and a PhD in the field of deep learning on graphs since 2022!). I like to talk about computer science, math, algorithms, and all things STEM.

I am continually learning and exploring new technologies and techniques, convinced that the best way to truly understand something is to get hands-on experience and try it myself.

This is my personal blog, I share my experiments and sometime interesting pieces of knowledge.
I hope that my posts will be both helpful and informative but also will spark your curiosity and inspire a passion for learning. If you find them useful, feel free to reach out to me :)

Thank you for stopping by and have a nice day!
