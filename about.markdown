## Welcome!

Hello there!
My name is Corentin, and I am a Datamancer (half data scientist, half software engineer) with over a decade of experience (with a PhD in the field of deep learning on graphs!).
I like to talk about computer science, math, algorithms, and all things STEM.

I am continually learning and exploring new techniques and technologies, convinced that the best way to truly understand something is to get hands-on experience and try it myself.

Here, I'll share some of my experiments and sometime interesting pieces of knowledge.
I hope that my posts will be both helpful and informative. If you find them useful, feel free to reach me out!

Have a nice day!
