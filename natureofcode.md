This project is inspired by [Daniel Shiffman](https://shiffman.net/){:target="_blank"}'s excellent book ["The Nature of Code"](https://natureofcode.com/){:target="_blank"}. It represents my personal journey in learning JavaScript and some algorithmic concepts.

### About the Project
- **Live Demo**: [https://godjam.github.io/](https://godjam.github.io/){:target="_blank"}
- **Source Code**: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/clallier/godjam.github.io){:target="_blank"}
- A random experiment is loaded each time you visit the page
- It was a very enjoyable learning experience, implementing various natural phenomena and algorithms in JavaScript. Daniel Shiffman is such a great model in scientific and computer science popularization!

### Some cool features:
- Each experiment has its own URL. For instance: 
  - [A 2D physics experiment](https://godjam.github.io/index.html?s=05_05){:target="_blank"}
  - Or [A flowfield experiment](https://godjam.github.io/index.html?s=06_07){:target="_blank"}
- Fully responsive, and some of them react to the device orientation.
- The previews in the menu are not static images - they are real HTML canvas elements, updated in real time!
