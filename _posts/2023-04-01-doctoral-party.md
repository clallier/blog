Today, I went to the Doctoral Graduation Ceremony organized by the College of Doctoral Schools at the University of Bordeaux.

I receive my physical diploma and I reconnected with many people I hadn't seen in a long time, (Hey, Guillaume and Intissar ðŸ‘‹).
We even had a small party at the end of the day.
It was a fun time!

*All the 2023 graduates from Math and Computer Science (I'm the third from the right).*

The replay is available on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/live/ls7bwM4dgEk?si=YIMJ8HwYZOnPM6TS&t=1268).

This event is relatively new at the University of Bordeaux, it was the 4th edition, so long live to this event.
Thanks to the University of Bordeaux for this day and congratulations to the other newly graduated doctors of this year ðŸš€

Have a great day and see you soon!
