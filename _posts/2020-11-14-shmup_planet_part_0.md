## Background and motivation

To summarize the motivation of this project, I **love making games** and I'm really interested in **web technologies**. Recently, I decided to learn about **shaders**, something I've wanted to do for a long time.
I found out interesting tutorials[^1] and it seems that Three.js is great for that.
I also think making games for mobile phones is an interesting challenge with strong input and compute constraints. 
Besides, I've been reading about **ECS** (Entity Component System) and **coroutines**. So, I thought this project would be a good chance to try all these things together.

My goal was to do a small project in my **free time over a few weekends**. I wanted to mix different parts of game development and web technology. It was important for the project to be simple and fit into my spare time. This was a chance for me to learn new things and have fun ðŸš€

## Key Features and Learning Points:

- **Shaders**: I'd like to try on one hand vertex and fragment shaders, and on the other hand the `EffectComposer`of Three.js.
- **Particles**: I wanted to have a visually appealing game, with a lot of effects like particles. So I wrote a small particle system, that ended in another shader.
- **Coroutines**: I wanted a simple way to organise sequences of events in the game. Sush sequences happend all the time and can be quite complicated like you have a bullet, if it hits something, you want to have multiples actions happend: delete the bullet, delete the thing it collide with, create particles
